This was a really challenging.

I worked on the UFO-level-1 portion of the assignment working creating the table as it should appear when you first open the webpage. I did this by creating the table through appending rows in a for each function. Once I got the table created I worked on the fillable datetime functionality on the webpage.

I tried to do UFO-level-2 and was unable to get the fillable lookup buttons to work correctly. I left them in the assignment so I can try to work on it later.

For fun I added an image from the Fire In the Sky which was filmed in my hometown in 1993! There is no copyright infringement intended.
